# Changelog

- 0.2.0 (2024-11-08)
  * Adds wNAF ("w-ary non-adjacent form") scalar multiplication, as
    well as fast 'sign' and 'verify' variants for Schnorr and ECDSA
    (disambiguated by a trailing apostrophe) that make use of it.

    Each wNAF-powered function requires a 'Context' consisting of
    precomputed secp256k1 generator multiples; one can be gotten via
    'precompute'.

    Note that the non-wNAF-powered sign and verify functions have
    incurred a slight performance decrease (on the order of tens to
    hundreds of microseconds) as a result.

  * Adds 'parse_sig' for parsing compact signatures.

  * Adds a dependency on the 'primitive' library (already transitively required
    via 'ppad-hmac-drbg').

- 0.1.0 (2024-10-19)
  * Initial release, supporting public key derivation and Schnorr &
    ECDSA signatures on secp256k1.
